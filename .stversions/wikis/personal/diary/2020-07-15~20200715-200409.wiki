I felt again like I was judging myself. That I wasn't doing enough, completing
enough, making enough progress on things. Some if it was related to work, some
of it was related to life stuff though, and that feels kind of bad.

That said, I did get the kitchen counter out of the van, and it's routed and
ready for sanding. 

Started meditating again.

I feel kind of bleh, I would love to have a glass of wine and relax, but that's
not in the cards at the moment. A shame, though, not to be able to enjoy.

My fork came for the mtb, it is SICK. I can't wait to put it together, I'm
getting antsy. I'm also happy I'm helping out the Chinertown guys with the logo,
and looks like we might be able to get some stickers cut as well. Sweet.

Nate hit me up, I'm not sure how I feel about that. I answered it, but idk if
we're ever going to be best buds. Oh well.

I need to talk with Aaron.
