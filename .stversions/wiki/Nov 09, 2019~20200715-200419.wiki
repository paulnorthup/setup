[[Today]] I'm going to build a rear wall for the van.

It should fit securely in the rear section of the van and offer some protection
against the wind and cold. We'll see how well that works.

I'm feeling a little tired, didn't get to sleep until late with Marie's
coughing. The dog needs to play today and I need to do some dishes and clean up
around the house. I've been slacking on my work.

Tonight I get to jam with Jeff/Chad/etc, so that should be pretty fun. Haven't
heard from wes yet about his Jeep but hopefully we can work on that too.

Financial state - effed. Need to get more organized, or maybe just continue to
play with the toys I have. I'll start prepping for winter, sharpening tools and
pons to get everything dialed in. With that done, it's only gas money and food
between me and a hell of a good time.

Got Taskwarrior set up again this morning. Maybe I'll use it this time :) Part
of the giant tmux config though so it should be much easier for me to use it,
now that it's always running and synced.

Loving the terminal env right now. It really makes me want to be on the computer
again. Haven't felt that in some time.

Enough for today. Good start.
