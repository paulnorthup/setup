Feeling a little slow this morning but had a great time with the boys last
night. Rocked some good dota and played a great support. Vision is all about
objectives.

Good to see Scott and Chad, need to make more time to spend with them. Chad is
hesitant to ice climb, but a couple more winter hikes and he might come around.

Hoping to get the rest of the wall built out today so I can have a free day
tomorrow. Maybe I can ride the bike at the fells with the dog. the Orange loop
would be fun.

If I'm good, I can get all my home life to-dos in order. That would be pretty
nice to have that written down and to stop worrying about them. Overall, feeling
okay though. Let's see if we can't keep the streak alive.
