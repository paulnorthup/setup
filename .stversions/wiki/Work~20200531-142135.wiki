- Investigate rollbar 1061/1060
  - Can't run a time flake in the past? Not sure how to use the same seed and
    time to check the validity of the flake.
  - Checking flaky spec docs
  - Can't match to any of the flakey spec patterns we have, will need help to
    debug. moving on to next rollbar
  - Look into sorting and whether or not that's consistent
  - Figure out where it went nil
  - Look at all the files involved in record_merge.rb
  - Found the build where the test flaked:
    https://circle2.bubtools.net/gh/BookBub/lello/254174#tests/containers/12
  - Ran in a console and had a found a potential point of failure with an id
    mismatch
  - Ran in a test console and couldn't reproduce the issue
  - Is there a better way of getting an activerecord class from a table name?
  - Ask infra if theres a flake around lazy loaded data. any circle config
    changes?
- Investigate rollbar 8962
  - seems that yanking a promotion that is "confirmed" is somehow attempting to
    confirm the promotion, and the health report can't transition to confirmed
    from confirmed (or so it seems?)

- SQL mailing changes
- https://github.com/BookBub/lello/pull/17850
- spec first and build later
- check subscribed, is one, make sure something in sql isn't already doing what
  we want
- unsubscribe them and check for 0
- temp tables, CTE, with clause help reduce large query into small pieces
- built a new with clause (own subquery)
- 'using' if both relate to the same db
- 'on' if they don't
- join = inner join will only join things in the center of a ven diagram
- left_outer_join joins the entire left of ven diagram, adds null values
- left outer join will return a row for each one-to-many:w

Mar 12, 2020
- Validation on the lello side to not allow a one time payment of $0 (being nice to the end user)
- Validation in taft so we can prevent a charge for $0, so we can protect tafts integrity. $0 is an error state and should not be allowed.
- Card for why the price in taft isnt updating when the promotion fee is changed (actual vs expected fee). Only edit if the charge hasn't gone through so we dont overcharge partners

  Handle for Listing Requests, Prorder Promotions, and New Release Promotions
  Fork on semi managed publishers


  Strategy
  - Add column for extend_credit (bool?) default to false
  - backfill partners in DISABLE_SEMI_MANAGED_INLINE_INVOICING flipper group to
    correct extend_credit state
  - follow inline-invoicing logic from promotions_confirm_controller to use
    extend_credit bool value for promotions
  - use extend_credit for preorder promotions
  - use extend_credit for new release promotions
  
  belongs on the partner role moreso than the partner
  
  we want a table that references the partner (partner will have partner id)
  partner has one "yet to be named" credit thing
  yet to be named thing has one
  relationship will need to exist when creating a partner
  
  New plan
  put it on the partner for now in a horribly named boolean value
  where the listing request invoice inline is, replace that with a policy object
  that receives a partner
  when you ask the policy object, it includes the guard method and the flipper
  bill immediately
