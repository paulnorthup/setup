Calling out sick today to have a hangout day. I wonder how much I do this, but I
really appreciate the fact that I can. Slept in till 10:45 so my body definitely
needed it.

Reworking the heroes in Scott Dota today, need to add some more but I'm happy
with where the game is at.

Finishing up andreas gift today, that will be good. Maybe I can get some work
done on the van as well.

I'm pretty caffeine rocked this morning so let's see if I can make use of it.

Waiting on payday really, bummed I'm in such a hole but I think I can do well in
the months to come.
