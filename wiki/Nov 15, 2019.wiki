Missed yesterday! I didn't notice but I guess because I was up so early I
thought the day hadn't started. Got it today though so that's good. 

Worked a bunch on ScottGame for his birthday. It's turning out pretty well,
though it's definitely a drinking game. Ihope he enjoys it.

I need to start cleaning today, and head to costco to get some party supplies.
I'll make a list this morning and try to get there when they open. I can bring
the dog and throw the ball for him too. Also need to review my daily tasks and
pay some bills this morning. Pay day... yey....

Trash day today too, so it's a good time to clean out the fridge.

I need two lists - one for things to buy today and one for things to buy/to do
tomorrow morning.

Much to do. let's get to it.
