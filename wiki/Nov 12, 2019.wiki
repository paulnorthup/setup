Woke up a little slow this morning but still on time. Working from home, and I
need to figure out how to get the radmin pages built.

I might ask Marie for a welder for christmas. Seems like a mig can work on the
motorcycle and general metals much better than the stick welder. Time to sell or
trash that piece of shit. Maybe someone on craigslist wants it.

Had fun last night talking with Jeff about guitars and pedal boards. I'll see
what I can do about putting something together for him. I'd like to make
something that doesn't look like shit, but it seems like they all look like
shit. Oh well.

I'll try to get to the van tonight, hoepfully I can finish up that wall and
clean things out, either today or tomorrow, to get that ready for next weekend.

Just added those to-dos to my todos and did my daily review. Awesome. I fucking
love my tmux setup, feel like I finally run my computer again.
